# Epidemics-and-Treatments-Database
I created a mock database in school for hospitals and clinics to track epidemics and their treatments

I created a database for the class IT-420 Advanced Information System Implementation.  I created this database on March 24, 2016.  Hospitals and clinics needed a database to help keep up with epidemics and their treatments.  There are many diseases out there and people can lose their lives over being improperly diagnosed so the database will be a guide for doctors to find the right treatments.  To create this database, I used Microsoft Visio to help with the design and coded the database in MySQL Workbench.
